      -> results in flows between 2 legal entities, if the entities are both co-located in the same context then need to record both sets of entries in their accounts.
If however, one entity falls outside the context then this results in a cf via banking integration, which results in receipts and payments expectations

scenario1:
trade between 2 co-located entities, should record dr/cr between the accounts
