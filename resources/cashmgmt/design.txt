trade between le1 and le2 for an instrument at a price
      -> results in flows between 2 legal entities, if the entities are both co-located in the same context then need to record both sets of entries in their accounts.
If however, one entity falls outside the context then this results in a cf via banking integration, which results in receipts and payments expectations

scenario1:
trade between 2 co-located entities, should record dr/cr between the accounts


chris invests $100 in product1
chris places an order for 100 AGL shares at bid R10.00 a share

setup entities and they have an attribute which dictates whether they are internally tracked.
adjust value into entity  

       
scope:
boundary is receiving the trade orders, not considering the
interaction with trader/investor, nor are we considering collection of
funds from investors. Therefore if we assume we receive a map which
includes the details of the trade order, 
order = {:src_entity, :xyz
 :trg_entity, :abc
 :amt, 100
 :currency, ZAR
 :product, P1
}

order needs to be added to an order execution queue. 
Need workers who process this queue to remove it from the queue and to
create a trade from this order. This trade needs to be executed 

order -> trade -> recognise liability
